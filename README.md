# SB Worklog MCP Server

### Rant Time
MCP or model context protocol is something that is gaining popularity recently in my locality and tech industry so I wanted to explore a bit more about it. Hence I created this small but useful project for creating work logs for me daily using my git commit history

Creating work logs is a bit teadious for me as I don't like typing the same stuff again and again I probably would much rather do things the manual way its a bit of hasstle to do that every day especially when I always forget.

## Actual Purpose
The focus of this project is to provide users a way to let the AI or LLMs in this case interact with project commit history and let it find out things for you like the following questions it can answer

1. What I worked on today and how many commits I made today alone?
2. If something breaks or we want to revisit a feature in the future some day this will help in knowing what I worked on last month or last week or yesterday?
3. It can also tell you the total number of commits that you made today or in a month which I guess could be a motivation for some of the developers


## Python Codebase
I built this using python for not so obvious reasons. I was actually tired working with Frontend and I want to work with python for backend stuff now and build something cool like API as a service as ASS for short. That was the simple reason why I built this tool in python.

The code should be easy to understand for anyone with python background.

If anyone wants to use this codebase please feel free to do so or add pull request for this so we can make something cool out of this. You can clone it as well and have it as your own. Make sure that you give attributes for this work else you know I don't like theifs


That's all thanks! :)
